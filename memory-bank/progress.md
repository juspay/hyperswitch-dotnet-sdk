# Project Progress

## What Works

*   **`Hyperswitch.Sdk`:** Core SDK structure is in place.
    *   `PaymentIntentResponse.cs` updated with `ErrorCode`, `ErrorMessage`, and `ExtensionData` properties to better capture API error details.
*   **`Hyperswitch.Sdk.Sample`:** Console app for automated SDK tests.
    *   Minor fix applied for potential build error related to `NextAction.RedirectToUrl`.
*   **`Hyperswitch.Sdk.DemoApi`:**
    *   ASP.NET Core Minimal API project setup.
    *   SDK referenced, client and services configured for DI.
    *   Swagger/OpenAPI enabled.
    *   **Direct SDK Function Mapping Endpoints Implemented:** Covers Payment, Refund, Customer, and Merchant services.
    *   Endpoints directly use SDK request/response models.
    *   **Response Logging:** All API responses (success and error) are serialized to JSON and logged to the console.
    *   Most custom DTOs removed.
    *   Build fixes applied.
*   **Memory Bank:** All core documentation files updated.

## What's Left to Build

**For `Hyperswitch.Sdk.DemoApi` & `Hyperswitch.Sdk`:**
1.  **Testing & Error Message Investigation:**
    *   User to rebuild the solution (`dotnet build server-sdk.sln`).
    *   User to run Demo API and test (e.g., failing payment cURL).
    *   User to observe console logs for `ErrorCode`, `ErrorMessage`, or `ExtensionData` in the `PaymentIntentResponse`.
2.  **SDK Model Adjustments (If Still Needed):** Based on testing, if Hyperswitch returns error fields not captured even with the new properties, further SDK model refinement might be needed.
3.  **Final Review of Endpoints:** Ensure all desired SDK functions are exposed and correctly mapped in Demo API.
4.  **API Key Configuration:** User needs to manage their API keys in `Program.cs`.

**For the SDK (`Hyperswitch.Sdk`) itself:**
*   Ongoing development and refinement.

## Current Status

*   `Hyperswitch.Sdk.DemoApi` is refactored for direct SDK function mapping and includes response logging.
*   `Hyperswitch.Sdk` model `PaymentIntentResponse` is enhanced for better error detail capture.
*   Awaiting user testing after a full solution rebuild to verify error message capture and overall functionality.
*   Memory Bank documentation is up-to-date.

## Known Issues

*   **Placeholder API Keys:** `Program.cs` uses placeholder API keys.
*   **Error Message Population:** The effectiveness of the new error fields in `PaymentIntentResponse.cs` needs to be verified through testing and console log inspection.
*   **Minimal Request Validation:** Validation within the Demo API is minimal.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Shifted Demo API from scenario-based to direct 1-to-1 SDK function mapping.
*   Added console logging for all API responses in Demo API.
*   Enhanced SDK's `PaymentIntentResponse` model to include specific top-level error fields and `JsonExtensionData` for better error detail capture from Hyperswitch API, based on OpenAPI spec.
*   Iterative bug fixing and Memory Bank updates throughout the process.
