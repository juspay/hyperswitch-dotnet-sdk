# Project Progress

## What Works

*   **`Hyperswitch.Sdk`:** Core SDK structure is in place.
    *   `PaymentIntentResponse.cs` updated with `ErrorCode`, `ErrorMessage`, and `ExtensionData` properties to better capture API error details.
*   **`Hyperswitch.Sdk.Sample`:** Console app for automated SDK tests.
    *   Minor fix applied for potential build error related to `NextAction.RedirectToUrl`.
*   **`Hyperswitch.Sdk.DemoApi`:**
    *   ASP.NET Core Minimal API project setup.
    *   SDK referenced, client and services configured for DI.
    *   Swagger/OpenAPI enabled.
    *   **Direct SDK Function Mapping Endpoints Implemented:** Covers Payment, Refund, Customer, and Merchant services.
    *   Endpoints directly use SDK request/response models.
    *   **Response Logging:** All API responses (success and error) are serialized to JSON and logged to the console.
    *   Most custom DTOs removed.
    *   Build fixes applied.
*   **Memory Bank:** All core documentation files updated.

## What's Left to Build

**For `Hyperswitch.Sdk.DemoApi` & `Hyperswitch.Sdk`:**
1.  **Testing & Error Message Investigation:**
    *   User to rebuild the solution (`dotnet build server-sdk.sln`).
    *   User to run Demo API and test (e.g., failing payment cURL).
    *   User to observe console logs for `ErrorCode`, `ErrorMessage`, or `ExtensionData` in the `PaymentIntentResponse`.
2.  **SDK Model Adjustments (If Still Needed):** Based on testing, if Hyperswitch returns error fields not captured even with the new properties, further SDK model refinement might be needed.
3.  **Final Review of Endpoints:** Ensure all desired SDK functions are exposed and correctly mapped in Demo API.
4.  **API Key Configuration:** User needs to manage their API keys in `Program.cs`.

**For the SDK (`Hyperswitch.Sdk`) itself:**
*   Ongoing development and refinement.

## Current Status

*   `Hyperswitch.Sdk.DemoApi` is refactored for direct SDK function mapping and includes response logging.
*   `Hyperswitch.Sdk` model `PaymentIntentResponse` is enhanced for better error detail capture.
*   Awaiting user testing after a full solution rebuild to verify error message capture and overall functionality.
*   Memory Bank documentation is up-to-date.

## Known Issues

*   **Placeholder API Keys:** `Program.cs` uses placeholder API keys.
*   **Error Message Population:** The effectiveness of the new error fields in `PaymentIntentResponse.cs` needs to be verified through testing and console log inspection.
*   **Minimal Request Validation:** Validation within the Demo API is minimal.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Shifted Demo API from scenario-based to direct 1-to-1 SDK function mapping.
*   Added console logging for all API responses in Demo API.
*   Enhanced SDK's `PaymentIntentResponse` model to include specific top-level error fields and `JsonExtensionData` for better error detail capture from Hyperswitch API, based on OpenAPI spec.
*   Iterative bug fixing and Memory Bank updates throughout the process.
# Project Progress

## What Works
- Core SDK structure is in place.
- Basic services for Payments, Customers, and Refunds are likely implemented (based on `systemPatterns.md`).
- `HyperswitchClient` provides an entry point.
- Request and Response models are defined.
- Memory Bank core files have been initialized.
- A sample scenario demonstrating saved card payment flow (`TestSavedCardPaymentFlowAsync`) has been added to `Hyperswitch.Sdk.Sample/Program.cs`. This includes:
    - Customer creation.
    - Initial payment creation with `setup_future_usage = "on_session"`.
    - Confirmation of initial payment with full card details.
    - Creation of a subsequent payment intent for the same customer.
    - Listing customer's saved payment methods (using `CustomerService.ListPaymentMethodsAsync(customerId)`).
    - Confirmation of the subsequent payment using the `PaymentMethodToken` and CVC.

## What's Left to Build (General SDK - to be refined)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration).
- Full implementation of all Hyperswitch API endpoints relevant to the SDK's scope.
- Detailed examples and usage documentation beyond the current sample scenarios.
- Potentially more advanced features like webhook handling support, idempotency key management, etc.

## Current Status
- **Overall:** SDK is in an early to mid-stage of development. Core functionalities are present, and sample scenarios are being expanded.
- **Memory Bank:** Core files initialized and updated after the recent task.
- **Current Task:** The task to add a saved card payment scenario to `Hyperswitch.Sdk.Sample/Program.cs` is completed.

## Known Issues (General - to be refined)
- (To be populated as issues are identified)
- Lack of comprehensive test suite might be an implicit issue.
- Documentation might be sparse.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Decision:** Create a .NET SDK to simplify Hyperswitch integration.
- **Memory Bank:** Adopted as a strategy for maintaining context and ensuring continuity due to memory resets between sessions. All core files were successfully initialized.
- **Saved Card Scenario Implementation:**
    - Adhered to the user-provided cURL flow as closely as possible using SDK methods.
    - Adapted to differences between direct API parameters (seen in cURLs) and the SDK's model properties (e.g., `PaymentConfirmRequest` does not take `CustomerAcceptance` or `Email` directly; `CardDetails` does not include `CardIssuer`/`CardNetwork`).
    - Modified `CustomerService.ListPaymentMethodsForClientSecretAsync` to use `ApiKeyType.Publishable`. This aligns the SDK call with the user's cURL that specifies a publishable key for the `GET /customers/payment_methods?client_secret=...` endpoint, leveraging the `HyperswitchClient`'s capability to switch API key types.
    - Used `PaymentMethodToken` from the listed saved payment methods for confirming the subsequent payment, along with CVC provided in `PaymentMethodData.Card`.
    - Addressed runtime errors by:
        - Removing a hardcoded `ProfileId` from payment requests to use the `HyperswitchClient`'s default, resolving a "Business profile ... does not exist" error.
        - Adding `JavaEnabled = true` to `BrowserInfo` in payment confirmations to resolve a "Missing required param: browser_info.java_enabled" error.
        - Adding `CardHolderName` to `CardDetails` in the initial payment confirmation.
        - Changing `AuthenticationType` to "no_three_ds" for payment intents in the saved card flow to troubleshoot a generic payment failure.
        - Updating `Shipping.AddressDetails` in `PaymentIntentRequest` to provide more complete address lines (`Line1`, `Line2`, `Line3`) and a more realistic `Line1` value ("123 Main St") to address a "Required field 'deliveryAddress.street' is not provided" error.
    - Resolved type conflicts related to `CustomerAcceptance` and `OnlineMandate` by:
        - Adding `CustomerAcceptance` property to `PaymentConfirmRequest.cs`.
        - Ensuring the sample code instantiates `new OnlineMandate()` for the `CustomerAcceptance.Online` property, aligning with the SDK's internal type (after discovering conflicts with self-created type files).
    - Updated `CustomerPaymentMethodListResponse.cs` to correctly map the `customer_payment_methods` JSON array to its `Data` property and added `IsGuestCustomer` to match API response for the client_secret variant of listing payment methods.
    - Modified `PaymentConfirmRequest.cs` to align with cURL for tokenized payments:
        - Changed `PaymentMethodToken`'s `JsonPropertyName` to "payment_token".
        - Added a top-level `CardCvc` property.
    - Updated the sample program to use the top-level `CardCvc` and adjust `PaymentMethodData` when confirming with a token, to avoid "missing card_number" errors.
    - Renumbered test scenarios in `Hyperswitch.Sdk.Sample/Program.cs` to be sequential for better clarity.
    - Updated `PrintPaymentDetails` in the sample program to attempt to display connector information from `PaymentIntentResponse.ExtensionData`.
- (Further decisions will be documented as they are made)
